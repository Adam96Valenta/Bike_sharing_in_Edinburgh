# Data analysis project in Python

## Analysis of bike sharing on Edinburgh from Just Eat Cycles

In this project, I analyzed the use of bike sharing in Edinburgh of Just Eat Cycles. I worked with two datasets. 
Edinburgh_bikes which contains data on all borrowed bikes. There is information about the beginning and end of the loan, the length of the loan, the name and coordinates of the starting and finishing stations. The second dataset, Edinburgh_weather contains information about the weather in the given city.

I used the following libraries in the project: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
